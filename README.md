# Decision-Tree-for-Iris-Dataset
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and evaluated using accuracy and classification report. A visualization of the decision tree is also included for better interpretability.
